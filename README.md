# Predicting-Customer-Churn-with-PySpark



**Libraries Used**

• Pandas === 0.23.4

• Numpy === 1.15.4

• Scikit Learn === 0.20.1

• Matplotlib === 3.0.2

**The Motivation for the Project**

I chose to work on this project for the following reasons:

•	I find the concept of customer churn to be intriguing and most companies view customer churn as a high-priority use case.

•	Spark is an exceptionally high-demand skill in 2019 and using the PySpark package in Python is a great way to familiarize myself with the framework.

•	This project was a great opportunity to familiarize with an industry I never worked in, which is the music service industry. The dataset used in this project mirrors how a dataset might look for a company such as Spotify.

•	Many of the approaches I used in this project are directly applicable to my present and future work projects.

**The files in the repository**

I included a python file containing the project. Unfortunately, I could not include other files due to the 25MB file size limitation per repository.

**A summary of the results of the outcome**

Using the data, I answered the following questions:

1.	The random forest classifier model had the highest F1 score at 84.7% when it comes to predicting customer churn in the provided data set.

2.	The attributes that were most predictive of customer churn in the random forest classifier model were days_active, days_paid, days_free, and Thumbs Down.
